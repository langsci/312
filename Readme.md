Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) is a nontransformational theory of
linguistic structure, first developed in the 1970s by Joan Bresnan and
Ronald M. Kaplan, which assumes that language is best described and
modeled by parallel structures representing different facets of
linguistic organization and information, related by means of
functional correspondences. This volume has five parts. Part I,
Overview and Introduction, provides an introduction to core syntactic
concepts and representations. Part II, Grammatical Phenomena, reviews
LFG work on a range of grammatical phenomena or constructions. Part
III, Grammatical modules and interfaces, provides an overview of LFG
work on semantics, argument structure, prosody, information structure,
and morphology. Part IV, Linguistic disciplines, reviews LFG work in
the disciplines of historical linguistics, learnability,
psycholinguistics, and second language learning. Part V, Formal and
computational issues and applications, provides an overview of
computational and formal properties of the theory, implementations,
and computational work on parsing, translation, grammar induction, and
treebanks. Part VI, Language families and regions, reviews LFG work
on languages spoken in particular geographical areas or in particular
language families. The final section, Comparing LFG with other
linguistic theories, discusses LFG work in relation to other
theoretical approaches.
